Dear Chris Mills,
I am aware my color choice is BAD. I am colorblind, I have no clue what looks right, I am just picking colors and tags willynilly. I have had 2 people tell me its really ugly. Forgive me. Regardless though, this all works (hopefully). VS Community tells me (more like screams at me with warnings) that I shouldnt use `"Binding"` because it can compile quicker than at runtime or whatever, but I honestly have no clue what I would use instead, maybe im just doing it wrong. Also VS Community likes to suggest 1 million times per block of code I write to "refactor it". It usually just formats it to (what im assuming is) the C# language standard. I'm not really sure, but my code looks really pretty now so thats a bonus.

I tried to model this close to what we have done in class, but I got so stuck in the weeds (with errors, and having the wrong .NET sdk, and 20 other things), so I went in a slightly different direction.
